# 3DLogic Solver #

Solver for the 3DLogic puzzle (game found [here](http://www.kongregate.com/games/alexmatveev/3d-logic) and [here](http://www.kongregate.com/games/alexmatveev/3d-logic-2-stronghold-of-sage) ).

Old stuff, did this around 2009 or so. 

This solver tackles the puzzle as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP), with some path-finding heuristics.
It is intended to be fast, though some of the harder cube configurations still take a while to crack.
